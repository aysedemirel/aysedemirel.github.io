Accessing the content of a website begins when a **client (the user)** sends a request to a **server**. The server then sends a response, delivering the requested content back to the user. IP addresses determine where this communication is directed. However, this raises an important question: where is this content actually stored?

In simple terms, the content is not hosted on someone's personal computer but rather on dedicated servers that are specifically configured for this purpose.

## Why Do We Need Hosting?

Imagine you have developed a website — you have written the code and prepared the content. As long as these files exist only on your personal computer, no one else can access them. This is where **web hosting** comes into play.

For a website to be publicly accessible, it must be uploaded to a powerful server that runs continuously. During development, you can use your own computer as a local server, but keeping it online 24/7, ensuring sufficient performance under heavy traffic, and maintaining proper security is difficult and costly.

To solve this, companies known as **hosting providers** offer remote servers that can be rented and managed externally. These servers are optimized for reliability and performance, ensuring that websites remain fast and available even under high traffic loads.

## Types of Hosting

There are several types of hosting services available today, including:

- Shared Hosting
- Dedicated Hosting
- VPS – Virtual Private Server
- Cloud Hosting
- Managed Hosting

Each option has its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of cost, performance, management complexity, user control, flexibility, and reliability.

## A Closer Look at Hosting Types

### Shared Hosting

This is the most affordable and beginner-friendly hosting option. Multiple websites share the same physical server and its resources—such as CPU, memory, and disk space. It is suitable for small-scale projects and low-traffic personal sites.

### Dedicated Hosting

In this setup, all server resources are allocated to a single user. It provides maximum performance, full administrative control, and enhanced security, making it ideal for large enterprises or high-traffic platforms. However, it is also more expensive and requires technical expertise to manage.

### VPS (Virtual Private Server)

A VPS bridges the gap between shared and dedicated hosting. A single physical server is partitioned into multiple virtual servers, each operating independently with its own resources and operating system. This gives users greater flexibility and control. It is a balanced solution for medium-scale projects.

### Cloud Hosting

Cloud hosting operates across a distributed network of multiple physical servers. This infrastructure allows resources to scale dynamically according to demand. When traffic spikes, the system automatically allocates additional capacity. With its flexibility, scalability, and reliability, cloud hosting has become one of the most popular hosting methods today.

### Managed Hosting

Managed hosting is ideal for users who want high performance without dealing with server administration. The hosting provider handles server maintenance, security updates, performance monitoring, and backups. This service is typically built on VPS or dedicated infrastructure.

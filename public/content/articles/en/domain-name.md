When accessing a website, we typically enter an address such as “www.example.com”. The “www” portion is common to most websites, so the key part to remember is “example.com”. This expression, “example.com”, is called the **domain name**.

## The Importance of Domain Names

On the Internet, devices communicate using **IP addresses**. However, memorizing the IP address of every website is impractical. While this was somewhat manageable in the early days of the Internet, it has become impossible today, given the existence of millions of active websites. For this reason, domain names were developed as human-readable labels that correspond to numerical IP addresses.

This is similar to how people save contact names instead of memorizing phone numbers. On the Internet, the same logic applies: “google.com” is easy to remember, but very few people know the IP address associated with it. When a user types the domain name into a browser, the browser uses the **DNS (Domain Name System)** in the background to translate the domain name into its corresponding IP address and establish a connection.

## Structure of a Domain Name

Let’s analyze the structure of the domain name **“en.wikipedia.org”**: The “org” at the far right indicates the type or purpose of the site. Before that is “wikipedia”; this is the site's unique identifier. The prefix “en” specifies the language or country code of the site. However, the country code does not always appear at the beginning; in some cases, it is appended to the end, as in the domain extension “.com.tr”

## Domain Extensions and Their Meanings

Each extension at the end of domain names, such as “.com”, “.org”, or “.net”, has a specific meaning. The most commonly used domain extensions and their general purposes are as follows:

- `.com` = Derived from “commercial.” Originally intended for commercial entities, it is now the most widely used domain extension.
- `.net` = Abbreviated from “network.” Commonly used by Internet service providers and infrastructure-related sites.
- `.org` = Short for “organization.” Typically used by non-profit or community-based organizations.
- `.info` = Abbreviated from “information.” Generally used for informational websites.
- `.edu` = Derived from “education.” Reserved for educational institutions.
- `.gov` = Short for “government.” Exclusively used by governmental organizations.
- `.tr` = Represents Türkiye (Turkey). Each country has its own two-letter country code top-level domain (ccTLD), such as `.us` for the United States, `.de` for Germany, or `.fr` for France.

## How to Obtain a Domain Name

To make a website publicly accessible, one must first register a domain name. Domains are rented for a specific duration (e.g., 1 year or 10 years) through intermediaries known as **domain registrars**.

When choosing a domain name, it should be concise, memorable, and relevant to the website’s content. A domain name establishes both the identity and the first impression of a website. Additionally, the choice of domain extension should align with the site’s purpose and available budget.

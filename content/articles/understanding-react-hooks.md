# Understanding React Hooks

React Hooks revolutionized how we write React components. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore everything you need to know.

## What are Hooks?

Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components.

### useState Hook

The `useState` hook allows you to add state to functional components:

```javascript
import { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Common Hooks

- **useState** - State management
- **useEffect** - Side effects
- **useContext** - Context API
- **useReducer** - Complex state logic

## Best Practices

1. Always call hooks at the top level
2. Only call hooks from React functions
3. Use custom hooks for reusable logic

> **Pro Tip:** Custom hooks should always start with "use" to follow React conventions.

## Conclusion

React Hooks have made functional components more powerful and easier to work with. Start using them in your projects today!
